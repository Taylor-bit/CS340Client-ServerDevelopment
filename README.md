# CS340Client-ServerDevelopment
A repository for my work completed throughout my CS-340 Client/Server Development course at Southern New Hampshire University

1.) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To ensure long-term use when writing programs, maintainability, readability, and adaptability are essential. An organized method of database interactions was made possible in this project by the CRUD Python module from Project One, which facilitated integration with the dashboard widgets in Project Two. Benefits from the modular strategy of employing a distinct CRUD class included faster debugging, less duplication, and code reuse. Future applications requiring database connectivity can make use of this module, whether it's to integrate with new systems or provide more functionality to the dashboard.

2.) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching challenges as a computer scientist requires the systematic breakdown of requirements, creating effective data structures, and putting scalable solutions into place. Before employing a structured CRUD-based approach, the database and dashboard requirements from Grazioso Salvare were reviewed for this project. This project required a more comprehensive, real-world perspective- taking into account data consistency, user interactions, and database efficiency- than previous projects that concentrated on specific scripts. To guarantee scalability and high-performance database solutions in future projects, I would employ strategies like entity-relationship modeling, database indexing, and API-driven solutions.

3.) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists create innovative, scalable, and effective solutions that drive companies forward. A well-organized database and dashboard system can improve operational efficiency, simplify data management, and facilitate decision-making in initiatives such as these. This project offers a user-friendly interface for analyzing data from animal shelters, which helps organizations like Grazioso Salvare quickly find suitable rescue animals without much effort. In the end, well-designed software solutions increase productivity and help businesses better concentrate on their primary goals.
